# Notes for LLM prompts (js_underscore)


**What is this Project?**
Concept: Turn-Based RPG with Highly Composable Move System
Inspirations:
1. Pokemon (element/status combat system)
2. Slay the Spire (relics/roguelite progression)
3. Balatro (quick refined gameloop)
4. Shin Megami Tensei (dark spiritual aesthetics)
Language: javascript
Platform: Browser

**Key Deliverables**
1. Tight Gameplay Loop (Combat -> Upgrade Character -> Repeat)
2. Moves composed of customizable Game Logic (prizing creativity)
3. Familiar but Deepened Game Systems (status effects, secondary effects)
4. Fallen Characters / Customized Moves embedded into the game for other players (upload/download fallen players as new encounters)

**Key Design Choices**
1. Data Driven Design: CombatMoves are composed of Modular segments and call functions in sequences
2. Systems over Effects: CombatMove Operations modify CombatState each step of the way, resolving side effects before moving forward
3. Asymetrical Multiplayer: Players fight AI Versions of other fallen players rather than actual players.
