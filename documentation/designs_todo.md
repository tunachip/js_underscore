Design Todo
--

None of this is set in stone, but we are starting by listing as many types of idea as possible
As we test the game, we need to pull mechanics in and out and see how they work together, what mix is best, etc


Game Loops

- Upgrade Moves
    1. Use Fragments to add / change abilities
    2. Upgrade Moves to Level 2 Moves
- Upgrade Character
    1. Change Starting Values (MaxHP, HP, MaxEnergy, Energy)
    2. Gain Blessings (Relic-Style Triggered/Static Effects)
    3. Use 'Contracts' to upgrade character, moves, and gain blessings
- Customize Moveset
    1. Have up to 6 (unless stated otherwise) moves - 4 in active pool, 2 in banked pool
    2. Learn Moves from Fallen Enemies
    3. Use initial moveset and Culture as base then modify via upgrade shops

Upgrade Methods:

- Fragments
