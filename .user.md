## Combat MVP TODOs

- Integrate interpreter into opcode reader: resolve meta/caster/targets/self across all operations so callers only pass move index + chosen targets.
- Add turn flow helpers: decision → execute → tick statuses/cooldowns/attunement turns and advance turn counter.
- Fix/verify elemental rules: ensure absorb/blocks/modify behave as expected and attunement spending is consistent; add a short test script to validate matchups.
- CLI runner polish: remove ad-hoc resolver once interpreter is in place; show current attunements/status turns after each action.
- Minimal browser UI: list moves, choose targets, display HP/energy/attunements/status, and append a combat log; hook into the shared executor.
- Data hygiene: align move templates with executor arg names (element/amount/target), and add a tiny move/encounter seed for testing.
